## kdd_integrated_anomaly_detection library

Library dependencies for running the benchmarking scripts.

We include minimal representative samples of UFF and Metric Store libraries here as `uff_example` and `metric_store_example` respectively.
These are intended for demonstration purposes only and should not be used except in conjunction with the executables in this repo.
These libraries are not maintained, nor are they open source software products of Databricks.
